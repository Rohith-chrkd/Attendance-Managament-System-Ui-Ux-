The technical task assigned by “PHISCAPE” is to design an employee attendance management system using UI/UX  with separate login as well as register tabs for both employee and admin. In the employee tab there must be the options for punch in and punch out with both date and time menu along with the option for submitting leave form. In the Admin tab , the Admin can access the list of employees working there, their basic details , attendance , leave application etc. From this the admin can either approve or reject the leave of the employee. The employee can also view the approval status of their leave.

I designed a platform for this purpose using ui/ux in figma. The name of the prototype I designed is “INIZIO” which means  new beginning . In this figma file I designed an index page showing the logo and name of the app , when entering any key or clicking on the tab there comes the main home screen. In this home screen there is the option to enter as Admin as well as Employee with separate buttons . When clicked in the Admin button it  shows an admin login tab. In the admin login tab there is the space for filling admin username as well as admin password (default values -  when pressed on “A” the username box is filled as “ADMIN” and when clicked on “P” the password box is filled with password the user can also view the entered password with the eye option in the right side of the text box) , if the user is a new user there is also the option for registering new user , there is also the options for forget password (When clicked on the forget password option it redirects to another tab where the user have to enter the username and new password twice to change the forgotten password). This also same in the case of Employee login tab ,when clicked on the Employee button in the home tab the employee login tab appears , the features are same as mentioned in the admin tab (here the default login values set for the employees are number pad 1,2,3  for 3 default employee login and “P” for password ). 

When clicked on the login button in the admin login tab it redirects to the admin dashboard

Admin Dashboard

In the admin dashboard there are the options for viewing the employees named as “Employee” in the side menu. For a little more detailed info of the employees there is also an option named “Employee Profile” ,when clicked in this option is shows a list including the name of the employee along with “click here” button on the right corner of the employee list. By clicking in this option the admin can view a brief  info of the employee in an attractive interface (all basic information , salary , their bank account, attendance, leave application their average performance in the previous task completion etc) (for reference out of 10 employees profile of 5 employees is given ). The admin can view the leave application of  employee from the leave application menu of the corresponding employee from their profile (present and past).From the admin dashboard the admin can access the leave application and there show 3 status (approved, rejected, pending), when clicked on the pending button there shows an option either to approve or to reject the leave. These are the interactive features in the admin tab. For making the admin tab little more attractive I used certain plugins from figma community like performance statistics etc . There is also a logout button in the right corner of the top menu . 

When clicked on the login button in the employee login tab it redirects to the employee dashboard

Employee Dashboard

In the employee dashboard there is the option for both punch in and punch out .When clicked in the “punch in” it redirects to a tab with a calendar where the user click and enter the date and the click the next button it redirects to another tab with a scroll timer clock to enter the check in time and when submit the attendance marked successfully popup appears and this is same as in case of “punch out” .In the dashboard there is also the option for applying for leave , when pressed in that button it redirects to a tab with a leave form where the employee can enter the dates (from when to when) and also enter the reason and then press submit. After submitting this leave form is forwarded to the admin. In the employee dashboard there is also the option for viewing the leave status weather it is approved or not . There is also an option to view the messages of the employees in the notification logo in the top menu. For making the employee dashboard  little more attractive I used certain plugins from figma community like performance statistics etc . There is also a logout button in the right corner of the top menu . 

All the tabs are connected using the figma prototyping tool

This is all about the attached figma file. Kindly go through the figma prototype  , Present the figma file and check all the features mentioned above
